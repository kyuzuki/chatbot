Second, give it to a friend who is told nothing about it other than to talk to them about this topic. Be sure that your conversations make clear whether it is a human or ELIZA who is speaking on each line. Write down some of your friend's impressions.\n",

    "# The Questions\n",
    "There are 17 different types of questions that my ELIZA implementation can answer about Lilo and Stitch, along with a handful of generic questions. 12 rules have 1 variable and 5 of have 2 variables, and the generic rules look for exact string matches. The basic interaction allows for answering the following questions/statements:\n",
    "- **hello**: responds with a random greeting from [*'Hi', 'Hello!', 'Hello', 'Howdy', 'Hey', 'Salutations', 'Hola'*]\n",
    "- **who are you**: responds with \"*I'm Eliza, and I'm an expert on Lilo and Stitch*\"\n",
    "- **how are you**: responds with a random selection from [*I'm fine, I'm good, TIRED, I'm a computer, I don't have feelings., I'm doing alright, How are you?, No really, how are you.*]\n",
    "- **how do you know so much about lilo and stitch**: responds with a random selection from [*I just do., I was programmed to., I do Disney trivia on weekends, M A G I C*]\n",
    "- It also has some basic programming to respond to input such as \"I am fine\", \"I'm fine, or asking a question back to the user when asked about itself. If the user ever types in *yes*, ELIZA will respond with \"*I see*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### One Variable Rules\n",
    "- 1.**who is ___**: Takes in one argument, which should be the name of a character. Responds with a description of that character from the `characters` dictionary, or from the `exp` table if the name of the character is given as `experiment #`.\n",
    "- 2.**what is experiment ___**: Takes in one argument, which should be a number. Responds with a description of that experiment from the `exp` table.\n",
    "- 3.**what is ___**: Answers questions about experiments and characters when referred to by name.\n",
    "- 4.**what does experiment ___ do**: Answers what each experiment does when referred to by number. Argument should be a number corresponding to an experiment in the `exp` table.\n",
    "- 5.**what does ___ do**: Answers what different characters do, whether a human character or an experiment listed in the `exp` table.\n",
    "- 6.**what is ____, where ____ contains 'your' and 'favorite'**: A similar rule to the **what is ___** rule, this one is more specific in that it also checks for the words 'your' and 'favorite', and answers with what its favorite experiment is.\n",
    "- 7.**favorite is ___**: Responds to statements about teh user's favorite character, when referred to by name.\n",
    "- 8.**favorite experiment is ___**\n",
    "- 9.**favorite is experiment __**: Rules 8 and 9 are defined in the same function, and respond to the user's favorite experiment.\n",
    "- 10.**where does ___ live**: Responds to questions about where a character lives\n",
    "- 11.**what is ___ job**: Responds to questions about the job a character has\n",
    "- 12.**how tall is ___**: Responds to questions about the height of each character\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Variable Rules\n",
    "- 1. **season ____ episode ____**: Answers questions about what happened in a given season and episode of the Lilo and Stitch TV Series\n",
    "- 2. **____ is better than ____**: Responds to statements asserting that one thing is better than another\n",
    "- 3. **love ____ and ____**: Responds to a statement about loving two things\n",
    "- 4. **does ____ travel to ____** and **does ____ go to _____**: Responds to statements about characters travelling or going to places.\n",
    "- 5. **can ____ ____** and **is it possible for ____ to ____**: Two rules that are meant to answer questions about whether a character has a certain ability."
