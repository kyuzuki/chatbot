His cyborg arms serve many purposes such as cybernatic wiry rope, laser guns, forked harpoon, and welding tool, and his cyborg eye has zoom functions and improves his aim.

The spell can be reversed by Angel singing the song backwards or by playing a recording of her song in reverse. She is in love with Stitch and is the closest one to him. Experiment 625, Reuben, has feelings for her, calling her ""toots"", ""sweet lips"" and ""hotcakes"", but as for Angel, she rejected him.

He is a prototype of Stitch; but while his powers, he is lazy, cowardly, and only makes sandwiches. Only referred to as 625 in the series and Stitch! The Movie, but was finally named Reuben by Lilo during Leroy & Stitch. He speaks English with a hint of a Brooklyn accent. Reuben serves as Gantu's wisecracking sidekick during the series.

Designed to be abnormally strong, virtually indestructible, super intelligent and very mischievous. He can think faster than a supercomputer, he is fireproof and bulletproof, can spit acid, can hear in different hearing levels, can see in the dark, can jump really high, can climb up walls and walk on ceilings, can roll into a ball, have super sight and hearing and lift objects 3000 times his own weight (but not an ounce more).

He also have a type of Alien-like outstretchable mouth. He is the first experiment to be created on Earth with limited alien technology and without Dr. Hämsterviel's funding and serves as Stitch's bitter, villainous rival. Designed to have all the powers/strengths of Stitch and 20 other experiments, but none of their weaknesses, and absolutely no ability to turn to good. All 627 can say is ""evil"". 627 was mostly stronger and healthier than Stitch. 627's other powers include telekinesis, electrokinesis, plasma shoot and ice breath. His only apparent weakness is his loud, uncontrollable laughter. Even though seemingly ""indestructible"", 627 was outwitted and dehydrated back into an experiment pod by Stitch and Lilo, using a commercially available home food dehydrator, and he had been dehydrated for three years. After this, he did not appear again except for in a video recording in ""Mrs. Hasagawa's Cats/Ace"" and a dream sequence in ""Remmy"". He is also briefly mentioned in Leroy & Stitch.

629,,Leroy,"Stitch's evil twin, with red fur, frilly ears, yellow teeth, bent antennae, three bent spines on his back, a fluffy tail, and a slightly deeper voice as well as two extra, retractable arms and retractable claws on his front paws. Jumba started creating him from a template similar to Stitch, until Dr. Hämsterviel captured him and forced him to make a ""new version"" of 626. Designed to have all of Stitch's powers, but he also has the ability to disguise himself as Stitch by changing his fur color from red to blue (Dr. Hämsterviel hates the color blue, so he told Jumba to make him resplendent red to match his cape) and instantly regrow his fur. Leroy is very physical, but also makes liberal use of his plasma gun. After naming him ""Leroy"", Dr. Hämsterviel used a cloning machine to create an army, then sent the original Leroy down to Earth to capture the 624 experiments remaining there. Fortunately, Jumba secretly programmed a failsafe into Leroy before he was charged: If Leroy (or his clones) hears the song ""Aloha Oe"", his nervous system will shut down. After his defeat, Leroy and his clones are all placed in jail with Hämsterviel. Leroy's number is never mentioned in the movie. Jumba tries to call him ""627"" as mentioned on the Disney website, but Gantu reminds him that he's already made experiment 627. He is voiced by Chris Sanders. He and all his clones are sent to jail at the end of the movie, where they are seen happily dancing to ""Jailhouse Rock"".",
