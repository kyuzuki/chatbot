      "ELIZA:  Stitch's evil twin, with red fur, frilly ears, yellow teeth, bent antennae, three bent spines on his back, a fluffy tail, and a slightly deeper voice as well as two extra, retractable arms and retractable claws on his front paws. Jumba started creating him from a template similar to Stitch, until Dr. Hämsterviel captured him and forced him to make a \"new version\" of 626. Designed to have all of Stitch's powers, but he also has the ability to disguise himself as Stitch by changing his fur color from red to blue (Dr. Hämsterviel hates the color blue, so he told Jumba to make him resplendent red to match his cape) and instantly regrow his fur. Leroy is very physical, but also makes liberal use of his plasma gun. After naming him \"Leroy\", Dr. Hämsterviel used a cloning machine to create an army, then sent the original Leroy down to Earth to capture the 624 experiments remaining there. Fortunately, Jumba secretly programmed a failsafe into Leroy before he was charged: If Leroy (or his clones) hears the song \"Aloha Oe\", his nervous system will shut down. After his defeat, Leroy and his clones are all placed in jail with Hämsterviel. Leroy's number is never mentioned in the movie. Jumba tries to call him \"627\" as mentioned on the Disney website, but Gantu reminds him that he's already made experiment 627. He is voiced by Chris Sanders. He and all his clones are sent to jail at the end of the movie, where they are seen happily dancing to \"Jailhouse Rock\".\n",

Designed to be abnormally strong, virtually indestructible, super intelligent and very mischievous. He can think faster than a supercomputer, he is fireproof and bulletproof, can spit acid, can hear in different hearing levels, can see in the dark, can jump really high, can climb up walls and walk on ceilings, can roll into a ball, have super sight and hearing and lift objects 3000 times his own weight (but not an ounce more). His only weakness is water, as he cannot swim due to his molecular density. When he becomes good, he has a heart of gold. His one true place is, of course, as Lilo's \"dog.\" He is the first experiment to be created without Dr. Hämsterviel's funding. He is the most successful experiment Jumba has made. He's also the main character and hero in the series and in the movies. After learning of his older \"cousins\", he and his friend, Lilo, make it their mission to give them a new purpose beyond chaotic mayhem. He has a romantic relationship with Experiment 624, Angel and, later, acts like a brother to both her and Reuben. He is voiced by Chris Sanders.

      "ELIZA:  Stitch's evil twin, with red fur, frilly ears, yellow teeth, bent antennae, three bent spines on his back, a fluffy tail, and a slightly deeper voice as well as two extra, retractable arms and retractable claws on his front paws. Jumba started creating him from a template similar to Stitch, until Dr. Hämsterviel captured him and forced him to make a \"new version\" of 626. Designed to have all of Stitch's powers, but he also has the ability to disguise himself as Stitch by changing his fur color from red to blue (Dr. Hämsterviel hates the color blue, so he told Jumba to make him resplendent red to match his cape) and instantly regrow his fur. Leroy is very physical, but also makes liberal use of his plasma gun. After naming him \"Leroy\", Dr. Hämsterviel used a cloning machine to create an army, then sent the original Leroy down to Earth to capture the 624 experiments remaining there. Fortunately, Jumba secretly programmed a failsafe into Leroy before he was charged: If Leroy (or his clones) hears the song \"Aloha Oe\", his nervous system will shut down. After his defeat, Leroy and his clones are all placed in jail with Hämsterviel. Leroy's number is never mentioned in the movie. Jumba tries to call him \"627\" as mentioned on the Disney website, but Gantu reminds him that he's already made experiment 627. He is voiced by Chris Sanders. He and all his clones are sent to jail at the end of the movie, where they are seen happily dancing to \"Jailhouse Rock\".\n",
